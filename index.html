<p>My name is Elizabeth Arellano and I am a Freshman in college studying Computer Science. I decided to study computer science because of how much it satisfied my interests and who I am as a person. My favorite subject is mathematics, as it is straightforward for the most part, and I found that Computer Science is like that as well. In addition, I would also say that I am a creative person, which I could also use in Computer Science. In my free time, I love to play music. I like to play the guitar and piano. I just started learning how to play the bass and the drums, so hopefully I can be an expert at that soon!</p>
